# context-extraction-and-similarity-analysis

Context extraction involves the process of identifying and capturing the relevant information surrounding a given text. It aims to go beyond the surface-level understanding of individual words and sentences by encompassing the broader context that influences their meaning and interpretation. By extracting context, NLP systems can grasp the intricate nuances, relationships, and connections that exist within a body of text, leading to a deeper understanding of the underlying content.
Similarity analysis, on the other hand, focuses on quantifying the resemblance or relatedness between different pieces of text. It involves measuring the similarity or dissimilarity of documents, sentences, or even word embeddings, enabling comparisons and ranking of textual data based on their resemblance. Similarity analysis facilitates information retrieval by identifying relevant documents or sentences that are similar to a given query, aids in building recommendation systems by finding similar items or users, and supports document clustering by grouping together related pieces of text.
